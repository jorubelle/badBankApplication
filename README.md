# BadBank Application

# Project Title: 
FrontEnd and BackEnd Banking Application

# Description: 
This app was a learning tool to create an application that used context and updated state across pages. 
I then refactored it to add an external database using MongoDB. The reason it is called a badbank is because it does not have any security, as you can see everyone's password. 

# Installation Guidelines: 
To use this app, clone the GIT and download it on your machine. Then through the terminal, use npm install to install the depenencies. If you want to install
them individually, check out the package.json file to check them out.

# Features: 
This app allows you to start with a zero balance and then add money to it. In the future, I want to add authorization and change the layout depending on if you are logged in or not.
